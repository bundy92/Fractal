# Fractal Pattern Generation with Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)

This project explores the generation of fractal patterns using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). Fractal patterns are intricate geometric shapes that exhibit self-similarity and complexity at different scales. The goal of this project is to train a GAN model to generate realistic and diverse fractal patterns.

## Introduction

Fractal patterns have applications in various fields such as computer graphics, digital art, and natural phenomena simulation. Generating realistic fractal patterns using GANs can enable the creation of novel visual effects, textures, and designs.

This project provides a framework for training a GAN model on a dataset of fractal patterns and using the trained model to generate new fractal patterns. Additionally, it includes utilities for evaluating the quality and diversity of the generated patterns.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/fractal-gan.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd fractal-gan
    ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

The project consists of several scripts for training, generating, visualizing, and evaluating fractal patterns using GANs. Here's a brief overview of each script:

- `train.py`: Script for training the GAN model on a dataset of fractal patterns.
- `generate.py`: Script for generating new fractal patterns using the trained GAN model.
- `visualize.py`: Script for visualizing the generated fractal patterns.
- `evaluate.py`: Script for evaluating the quality and diversity of the generated fractal patterns.

Before running any of these scripts, ensure that you have prepared your dataset of fractal patterns or downloaded a suitable dataset for training.

## Training

To train the GAN model on your dataset of fractal patterns, follow these steps:

1. Prepare your dataset and place it in a directory named `data`.
2. Adjust the hyperparameters and configuration settings in the `train.py` script as needed.
3. Run the `train.py` script:

    ```bash
    python train.py
    ```

4. Monitor the training progress and evaluate the model's performance.

## Generating Fractal Patterns

Once you have trained the GAN model, you can use it to generate new fractal patterns. Follow these steps:

1. Run the `generate.py` script:

    ```bash
    python generate.py
    ```

2. The generated fractal patterns will be saved in the `generated` directory by default.

## Evaluation

To evaluate the quality and diversity of the generated fractal patterns, you can use the `evaluate.py` script. Simply run the script:

```bash
python evaluate.py
```

The script will calculate metrics such as the Inception Score to assess the performance of the GAN model.
